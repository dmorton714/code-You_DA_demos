### Project 3: m3w1-4

#### Introduction
Project 3 focuses on the integration of Pandas with local in-memory databases using Python. Students will learn how to add a CSV file to a local database, perform basic queries, and gradually build up to more complex queries, including joins and multi-conditional queries.

#### Goals
- Understand the process of adding data to a local in-memory database.
- Learn to perform basic queries on the database.
- Build proficiency in more advanced queries, including joins and multi-conditional queries.

#### Usage
Students should follow the project sequentially, practicing each concept introduced. The goal is to progressively enhance their skills in working with databases and querying data using Pandas.
